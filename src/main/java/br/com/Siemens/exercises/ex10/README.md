# String Length Calculator

Make a program in C/C++ or Java language that calculates the length of a string informed by the user (do not use any pre-existing function or method for this, such as len(), count(), strlen() or lenght());

## Repository Information

This repository contains a **Java solution** for the tenth exercise from *Programming Skills Challenge*,  

## Problem Description

The task is to write a program that:

Prompts the user to input a string.

Calculates the length of the string by iterating through its characters.

Displays the length of the string to the user.

The program must not use any pre-existing functions or methods like length(), len(), or strlen().

## Solution

The solution is implemented in Java and follows these steps:

Use a Scanner object to read the user's input.

Initialize a counter variable to store the length of the string.

Iterate through each character of the string using a for-each loop.

Increment the counter for each character in the string.

Display the calculated length to the user.

## How to Test and Validate

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java program using the following command:
   javac StringLengthCalculator.java

## Online Testing
